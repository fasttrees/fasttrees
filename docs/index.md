# Install fasttrees

You can easily install `fasttrees` via `pip`.

```bash
pip install fasttrees
```

# When to use fast-and-frugal trees

Fast-and-Frugal Trees tend to do well on real-world data prone to (human) error, as they disregard information that doesnâ€™t seem very predictive of the outcome. A typical use case is in an operational setting where humans quickly have to take decisions. You could then fit a fast-and-frugal tree to the data in advance, and use the simple resulting tree to quickly make decisions.

# Usage

```python
from fasttrees import FastFrugalTreeClassifier


# Instantiate a fast-and-frugal tree classifier
fc = FastFrugalTreeClassifier()
# Fit on your data
fc.fit(X_train, y_train)
# View the fitted tree (this is especially useful if the predictions
#  will be carried out by humans in practice)
fc.get_tree()
# Predict
preds = fc.predict(X_test)
# Score
fc.score(X_test, y_test)
```
